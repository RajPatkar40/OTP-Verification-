This program is used for OTP (One-Time Password) generation, delivery, and verification via email. It is commonly implemented in systems where secure verification of a user's identity is required, such as account logins, password resets, or two-factor authentication.

How It Works
Generate OTP:

A random 6-digit numeric OTP is created using a combination of math and random modules.
Email Setup:

Uses Python's smtplib to connect to Gmail's SMTP server.
Requires your Gmail account credentials (email and app password).
Send OTP via Email:

The program sends the generated OTP to the email address provided by the user.
OTP Verification:

The user enters the OTP they received.
The program checks if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP.
Validation:

If the OTP matches, the user is verified. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
Steps to Create and Use This Program
1. Prerequisites
Install Python (if not already installed).
Enable SMTP access for your Gmail account:
Go to your Google account settings.
Enable 2-Step Verification.
Create an App Password for third-party apps.
2. Code Implementation
Import required modules: os, math, random, smtplib.
Generate a 6-digit OTP using a loop and random selection.
Configure the SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) for sending the email.
Use smtplib to send the OTP to the user's email.
Implement verification by comparing the input OTP with the generated one.
3. Run the Program
Save the code as a .py file (e.g., otp_verification.py).
Run the script in a terminal or IDE.
Enter the recipient's email address when prompted.
Enter the OTP received in the email to verify.
Applications
User authentication in web and mobile applications.
Password recovery mechanisms.
Secure transaction verification.
